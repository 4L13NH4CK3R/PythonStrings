# Python Strings 
## Basic String Structures written in Python Languages
  
When we get started with programming in Python, we need to be able to print things on the screen.
And these simple commands will give us aid & support in doing that.

We can print a single line like so;
```
print("Hello World")
```
  
And then we can have multiple lines of strings display on different lines;  
**Example #1;**
```
print("Hello")
print("World")
```
**Example #2**
```
print("""Hello
World""")
```
   
And we can even add Line Breaks in between our strings by using \n like so;
```
print("Hello")
print('\n')
print("World")
```
